The NVIDIA MMS4A00 is a 1600Gb/s 2xDR4, single mode optical transceiver supporting the XDR 800Gb/s InfiniBand protocol. The line rate is 200Gb/s using Pulse Amplitude Modulation at 4-channels denoted as 200G-PAM4 enabling two data bits to transfer per clock pulse.

The electrical configuration is 8-channels of 200G-PAM4. Optical configuration is based on two Datacenter Reach, 4-channel (2xDR4), 800Gb/s optical connectors.

Optical connectors are Multiple Push-On 12-fiber, Angled Polished Connector or MPO-12/APC. Two MPO-12/APC optical connectors are used per transceiver.

The 2x800G transceiver engine enables the InfiniBand Quantum-X800 QM3400, 72-cage switch to support 144-ports of 800Gb/s.

Based on 9-um, single mode fibers, the main application is linking two switches together up to 500-meters, or to two 800G links to two switches or network adapters for storage and compute servers. The 500-meter length assumes two optical patch panels or four optical connectors in the link.

NVIDIA’s transceivers guarantee optimal operation in NVIDIA end-to-end InfiniBand systems, and rigorous production testing ensures the lowest bit error rates, low-latency, and best out-of-the-box installation experience, performance, and durability.

The NVIDIA MMS4A20 is an 800Gb/s single-mode optical transceiver supporting the XDR 800Gb/s InfiniBand protocol. It is used to link the Quantum-X800 QM3x00 switches using Twin-port OSFP 2x800Gb/s transceivers to the dual 800Gb/s ConnectX-8 mezzanine card in liquid cooled system and ConnectX-8 PCIE cards. OSFP cages are located in the compute tray front-panel.

The line rate is 200Gb/s using Pulse Amplitude Modulation of 4- channels denoted as 200G-PAM4, enabling two data bits to be transferred per clock pulse. The electrical configuration is 4-channels of 200G-PAM4. The optical configuration has one, 500-meter, Datacenter Reach, 4-channel (DR4), 800Gb/s optical connector, and is a single Multiple Push-On 12-fiber, Angled Polished Connector or MPO-12/APC. One MPO-12/APC optical connector is used per transceiver.

Based on 9-um, single mode fibers, the 800G transceiver can reach up to 500-meters, supporting large GPU clusters.

The plug formfactor is a single-port OSFP (Octal Small Formfactor Plug) and uses a Riding Heat Sink (RHS) or flat-top OSFP connector with the cooling fins on top of the ConnectX-8 cage. This can also be used in liquid-cooled Riding Heat Sink (RHS) applications.

NVIDIA’s transceivers guarantee optimal operation in NVIDIA end-to- end InfiniBand systems and rigorous production testing ensures the lowest bit error rates, low-latency, and best out-of-the-box installation experience, performance, and durability.
